        "*   The current model's accuracy (57.95%) is relatively low for image classification. Further improvements to feature extraction (e.g., using more sophisticated techniques than simple pixel flattening) or exploring more complex model architectures (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks) are necessary.\n",
        "*   Given the low accuracy, it would be beneficial to perform a deeper error analysis on misclassified images to understand common failure patterns and guide future model enhancements.\n"
